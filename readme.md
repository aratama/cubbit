![screenshot](https://rawgit.com/aratama/cubbit/master/res/screenshot/screenshot5.png)

Minecraft-like sandbox game written in PureScript. This project is quite primitive yet. See [my articles](http://qiita.com/hiruberuto/items/5321d8cebce7b87851f6)(Jaapanese) for more information.


## Demo

You can play the working demo at some one of following links if you are luckey. Google Chrome is most suitable but it is also available in other modern browsers include Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on Safari yet.

* [Playable Demo on GitHub Pages](https://aratama.github.io/cubbit/)
* [Playable Demo on RawGit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/aratama/cubbit/9e1f874869434c40e7853f2766c34221ae7cf26b/docs/index.html) (Faster than GitHub pages!)

W/A/S/D key to move the charactor. Right mouse drag or Q/E/R/F/T/G key to look  around. Space key to jump. To edit terrain blocks, press some button at the bottom of screen. Have fun!
